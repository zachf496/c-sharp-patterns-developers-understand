# Singleton

## Problem it solves
Often times you will want one global instance of an object instead of using `static` objects.

## Common Uses
The Singleton pattern is a good option to use when you'd like to restrict the creation of an object to only one instance. 

A common use may be to use a global object to work as a service object.
