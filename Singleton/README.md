# Singleton

##Examples Usages
The Singleton pattern is a good option to use when you'd like to restrict the creation of an object to only one instance. 

It can also be used to create a service that persists throughout the life of the application.

##Pros
This can often be used to create a service that gets lazily created on first use. As opposed to `static` classes, you can add extension methods to a Singleton in a different class.

##Cons
Unit tests can be more difficult to write as the internals of a Singleton are hard to access. However using Inversion of Control (IoC) you can get around some of these issues.
