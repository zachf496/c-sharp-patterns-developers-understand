            //If that happens, you'd have to ask them to replace all references to 'ProductOne' and substitute 'ProductTwo' in their application and then recompile.
            //This is not ideal, we'd really like our client to not have to do anything with their code.

            //If you use an interface and a factory, your client wouldn't have to change any of their code because the client delegates the creation of
            //the product to the factory. Therefore as long as the factory returns an 'IProduct', the fact that it's returning 'ProductTwo' or 'ProductThree' matters not to
            //the client application.

            //this returns ProductTwo but could just as well return ProductThree and no changes would be needed to the code below.
