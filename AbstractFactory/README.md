# Abstract Factory

## Problem it solves
Super similar to the [Simple Factory](../SimpleFactory/README.md) except the `.Create()` method returns an abstraction.

## Common Uses
The advantage over the Simple Factory is that this only depends on an abstraction whereas the Simple Factory depends on a concrete class.
